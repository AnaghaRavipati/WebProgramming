<b><u id="what-is-cs">What is cybersecurity?</u></b>
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users via ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes. <br>

<b><u id ="types_of_ca">Types of cyberattacks:</u></b><br>
1. <b>Phishing: </b>Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information. It’s the most common type of cyber attack. You can help protect yourself through education or a technology solution that filters malicious emails.<br>
2. <b>Social engineering: </b>Social engineering is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. They can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data. Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats listed above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source.<br>
3. <b>Ransomware: </b>Ransomware is a type of malicious software. It is designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored.<br>
4. <b>Malware: </b>Malware is a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer.Cyberattackers use harmful software such as spyware, viruses, ransomware, and worms known as malware to access your system's data. When you click on a malicious attachment or link, the malware can install itself and become active on your device.<br>
5. <b>Spoofing: </b>Cyber attackers will sometimes imitate people or companies to trick you into giving up personal information. This can happen in different ways. A common spoofing strategy involves using a fake caller ID, where the person receiving the call doesn’t see that the number is falsified. Other spoofing methods include subverting facial recognition systems, using a fake domain name, or creating a fake website.<br>
6. <b>Denial of service attack: </b>A denial-of-service attack causes an entire device or operating system to shut down by overwhelming it with traffic, causing it to crash. Attackers don’t often use this method to steal information. Instead, it costs the victim time and money to get their systems up and running again. Cybercriminals typically use this method when the target is a trade organization or government entity.<br>

<b><u id="prevention">How to prevent cyberattacks?</u></b><br>
1. <b>Update software: </b>Up-to-date software systems are more resilient than outdated versions, which may be prone to having weaknesses. Updates can correct any flaws and weaknesses in the software, so having the latest version is optimal. Additionally, consider keeping software systems updated by investing in a patch management system.<br>
2. <b>Install a firewall: </b>Firewalls are helpful in preventing a variety of attacks, such as backdoors and denial-of-service attacks. They work by controlling the network traffic moving through your system. A firewall will also stop any suspicious activity it deems potentially harmful to the computer.<br>
3. <b>Encrypt data: </b>Data encryption is a popular way to prevent cyberattacks, and it ensures data is only accessible to those who have the decryption key. To successfully attack encrypted data, attackers often have to rely on the brute force method of trying different keys until they can guess the right one, making breaking the encryption challenging.<br>
4. <b>Using strong passwords: </b>You should have strong passwords to prevent attacks and avoid using the same passwords for different accounts and systems. Using the same password repeatedly increases the risk of giving attackers access to all your information. Regularly updating your passwords and using passwords that combine special characters, upper and lowercase letters, and numbers can help protect your accounts.<br>

<b><u id="tools">Common tools used by cybersecurity professionals </u></b><br>
1. <b>Kali linux: </b>Kali Linux is among the most common tools used in Cyber Security. This operating system consists of a range of tools that are useful in security auditing, network and system scanning for vulnerabilities, etc.One of the main advantages of this platform is that Cyber Security experts with different levels of understanding can use it, making it an ideal choice even for entry-level professionals. Besides, a lot of the tools offered by Kali Linux are easily executable, allowing users to monitor the company’s network security systems using a single click.<br>
2. <b>John the ripper: </b>Security experts use John the Ripper to test the strength of passwords. Its design helps in exposing weak passwords that pose security threats to a particular system. In the beginning, it was only designed for the UNIX platform, but the new versions allow it to work on other operating systems as well, such as DOS, Windows, OpenVMS systems, etc.John the Ripper searches for complex ciphers, encrypted login credentials, and hash-like passwords to find any weak password. This tool is developed and updated regularly to make sure that it offers accurate results during penetration testing. It is among the most ideal choices of Cyber Security experts to enhance password security.<br>
3. <b>Wireshark: </b>Wireshark was earlier called Ethereal. It is among the best tools for Cyber Security, based on the console. It is a packet sniffer tool that allows professionals to analyze network protocols and sniff real-time networks in search of any vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Moreover, it collects necessary information related to the levels of network traffic.Cyber Security professionals use this tool to store data packets and to identify the behavior and characteristics that each packet exhibits. This knowledge helps in identifying the weakness of network security. It basically keeps an eye on the network packets and presents them in a readable format. It is one of the best Cyber Security open-source tools available.<br>
4. <b>Tcpdump: </b>Tcpdump is a useful packet sniffing tool for networks. It helps in monitoring and logging TCP/IP traffic that is shared over a network. This command-based software tool analyzes the traffic of the systems, along with the network that the traffic goes through. Besides, this tool tests the network security by segregating TCP/IP data traffic received via the Internet. Tcpdump also defines the contents of the network traffic packets.<br>
5. <b>Splunk: </b>Splunk is a system security tool known due to its versatility and speed. It is one of the best tools to monitor network security. Splunk is used to conduct real-time network analysis and perform historical searches to look for threat data. This user-friendly tool is equipped with a unified user interface, along with numerous functionalities and techniques that help in the process of searching for required information.It is an all-rounded system security tool that is also used to gather, store, and index data in repositories to generate real-time alerts, reports, visualizations, graphs, and dashboards.<br>
