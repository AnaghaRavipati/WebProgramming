<b><u id="dsa">What is DSA?</u></b><br>
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) refer to the study of methods for organizing and storing data and the design of procedures (algorithms) for solving problems, which operate on these data structures. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant.<br>

<b><u id="data-structures">What are data structures?</u></b><br>
A data structure is a way to store data.Data structures give us the possibility to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.
Data structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help in managing and organizing data, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency.
<br>In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures:
<br>1.Primitive Data Structures are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.
<br>2.Abstract Data Structures are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

<br><b><u id="algorithms">What are Algorithms?</u></b><br>
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.Algorithms are fundamental to computer programming as they provide step-by-step instructions for executing tasks. An efficient algorithm can help us to find the solution we are looking for, and to transform a slow program into a faster one.<br>

<b><u id="common-ds">Common data structures to learn</u></b><br>
1. <b>Array: </b>Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access. Each element has a unique index number.<br>
2. <b>String: </b>A string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. It is considered a data type that allows for the manipulation and processing of textual data in computer programs.<br>
3. <b>Linked lists: </b>A linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations.<br>
4. <b>Matrix: </b>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements, arranged in rows and columns. It is represented as a rectangular grid, with each element at the intersection of a row and column.<br>
5. <b>Stack: </b>Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.<br>
6. <b>Queue: </b>A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order. It follows the principle of “First in, First out” (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.<br>
7. <b>Heap: </b>A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value. Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.<br>
8. <b>Hash: </b>Hashing is a technique that generates a fixed-size output (hash value) from an input of variable size using mathematical formulas called hash functions. Hashing is used to determine an index or location for storing an item in a data structure, allowing for efficient retrieval and insertion.<br>
9. <b>Tree: </b>A tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a top node called the root and nodes having child nodes. It is used in computer science for organizing data efficiently.<br>
10. <b>Graph: </b>A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.<br><br>

<b><u id="common-alg">Common algorithms</u></b><br>
1. <b>Searching algorithms: </b>Searching algorithms are used to locate specific data within a larger set of data. It helps find the presence of a target value within the data. There are various types of searching algorithms, each with its own approach and efficiency.<br>
2. <b>Sorting algorithms: </b>Sorting algorithms are used to arranging the elements of a list in a specific order, such as numerical or alphabetical. It organizes the items in a systematic way, making it easier to search for and access specific elements.<br>
3. <b>Divide and conquer algorithms: </b>Divide and conquer algorithms follow a recursive strategy to solve problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems, solving those subproblems, and combining the solutions to obtain the final solution.<br>
4. <b>Greedy algorithms: </b>As the name suggests, this algorithm builds up the solution one piece at a time and chooses the next piece which gives the most obvious and immediate benefit i.e., which is the most optimal choice at that moment. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to the global solutions are best fit for Greedy.<br>
5. <b>Recursion: </b>Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. It is usually used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem. For Example: Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Factorial Calculation and Fibonacci Sequence etc.<br>
6. <b>Backtracking: </b>As mentioned earlier, the Backtracking algorithm is derived from the Recursion algorithm, with the option to revert if a recursive solution fails, i.e. in case a solution fails, the program traces back to the moment where it failed and builds on another solution. So basically it tries out all the possible solutions and finds the correct one.<br>
7. <b>Dynamic programming: </b>Dynamic Programming is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.<br>
8. <b>Graph algorithms: </b>Graph algorithms in data structures and algorithms (DSA) are a set of techniques and methods used to solve problems related to graphs, which are a collection of nodes and edges. These algorithms are designed to perform various operations on graphs, such as searching, traversing, finding the shortest path, and determining connectivity. They are essential for solving a wide range of real-world problems, including network routing, social network analysis, and resource allocation.
